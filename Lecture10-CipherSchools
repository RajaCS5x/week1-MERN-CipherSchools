 CSS part 2 - Class 11

 Properties and Targeting using CSS :->

ID should be unique for each element
targeting ID we use #ID_Name

CSS doesn't give error its just work is to implement id IDs are same it change those all things so write Unique IDs

#header
{
  background-color: red;
}
#para1
{
  font-weight: bolder;
}

Classes are targeted by .Class_Name

.para
{
  letter-spacing: 1px;
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: red;
}

Targeting by Element Name

p
{
  font-family:serif;
  color: blue;

}

Specificity (Priority : ID>100 Class>10 Tag>1)
If a element has both ID and class then it use Specificty for showing styles

#Header{color:brown}
.Header{colro:blue}
Header{color:yellow}

So According to Specificity #Header Styles will be shown/Implemented

If some Style given to parent then it will transfered to it's children also As CSS has D.O.M(Document object model) Model [representation of html document tags in form of parent child relationships with structure similar to TREE Data structure]
